# Genetic-Algorithm-Trading-Strategy-Optimizer
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize parameters of technical trading strategies. It systematically evolves combinations of indicator parameters (like RSI, MA, ATR, etc.) to maximize performance.

## Why Use Genetic Algorithms for Strategy Optimization?
Optimizing trading strategies with multiple technical indicators quickly becomes a combinatorial challenge. For instance, even modest parameter ranges across just 8 variables can result in billions of possible combinations. Exhaustively testing all of them (grid search) is computationally expensive and inefficient.

This project demonstrates how a Genetic Algorithm (GA) can efficiently explore this space to find high-performing configurations, without needing to test every possibility.
